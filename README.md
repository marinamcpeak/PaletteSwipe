# PaletteSwipe

## Overview

PaletteSwipe is an innovative grid-based puzzle game, merging the mechanics of a Rubik's cube with the rules of Sudoku, but with a colourful twist. Developed in Swift with SwiftUI, this game challenges players to strategically arrange colors by swiping rows and columns, similar to manipulating the top layer of a Rubik's cube.

### Key Features

- **Grid-Based Puzzle**: A unique blend of Sudoku and Rubik's cube principles, focusing on colour arrangement.
- **Sudoku Colour Rules**: Every column, row, and block must contain all five distinct colours.
- **Rubik's Rules Adapted**: Players can swipe to move columns and rows. However, the center cross and the edges of the grid remain fixed, offering a familiar yet distinct puzzle-solving experience.

## Game Status

PaletteSwipe is currently in early development. Gameplay mechanics and user interface are being actively updated to create an engaging and challenging experience for puzzle enthusiasts.

### Development Phase

- **Current Focus**: Enhancing the swiping mechanics and color arrangement algorithms.
- **Upcoming Features**: Planning to introduce different levels of difficulty tied to specific colour arrangments

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Arrange the colours so that each row and column contains all five colors without any repetition.
2. **Controls**: Swipe horizontally or vertically to move an entire row or column. Remember, the center cross and the edges of the grid are immovable.
3. **Strategies**: Plan your moves carefully. Each swipe can significantly change the grid's layout, requiring foresight and strategy.
